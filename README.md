## Welcome to Brady Werkheiser's GitHub

I will be using this site to post about projects I'm working on and general musings.

My professional interests include cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and marketing.

Outside of work my interests include Bhakti Yoga, reading, editing Wikipedia, and spending time with friends.

Hare Krishna!
