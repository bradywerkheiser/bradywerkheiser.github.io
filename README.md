## Welcome to Brady Werkheiser's GitHub

I will be using this site to post about projects I'm working on and general musings.

My professional interests include cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and marketing.

Outside of work my I practice Bhakti Yoga, read, edit Wikipedia, and spend time with friends.
